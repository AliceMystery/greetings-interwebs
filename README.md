my first repository

Ahhh here we go. This seems pretty cool.
Fledgeling coder here. I am studying python at werk for many reasons. I have been a computer debugger for about a year and a half now. Which has led to me learning about code in the first place and now I wish to know more. Sometimes it seems like madness, but, then again, it looks like alot of fun.

My first step into the digital world of github!
